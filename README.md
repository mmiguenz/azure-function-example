# azure-function-example

This is a simple example of an Azure Function wrote in C#.

This example is about a function which would be used to answer if a given object with an age property is admitted or not.
The aim of this example is just to give a simple and easy business case just to complement the full implementation of an Azure function running inside a Docker Container which you can follow in this link:
